# Feature #
Add "selectedDate" props to display selected date
If "startDate" is earlier than "selectedDate", it enables the option to navigate between these dates without disabling.

# Example of use: #
<VueTailwindPicker
  :start-date="startDate"
  :selected-date="selectedDate"
  @change="(v) => selectedDate = v"
>
</VueTailwindPicker>

data(){
  return:{
    startDate: "2020-01-01",
    selectedDate: "2020-05-01",
  }
}


I'm working on it to make a commit
